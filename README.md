# TasksApp
This is a ToDo app. This repo will be continuously refined and maintained as it 
is a template repo. What this repository represents is a basic template for a 
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) app that can be extended with more complex
algorithms or shifted to represent an application for purposes other than 
creating a ToDo list.
